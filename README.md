# inference_engine2

This project has been renamed as the English Lanuage Logical Calculator.  I only leave it on Github so that potential employers have evidence that I have been coding since Dec 2013.  Even though this project's first commit dates back to 2017, it is reasonable to assume that this project represents my first attempt at coding.
